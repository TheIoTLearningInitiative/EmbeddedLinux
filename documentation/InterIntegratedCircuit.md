Inter Integrated Circuit
==

> IÂ²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit), pronounced I-squared-C, is a multi-master, multi-slave, single-ended, serial computer bus invented by Philips Semiconductor (now NXP Semiconductors). It is typically used for attaching lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C)

### Required Hardware

One I2C sensor

## Kernel Integration
