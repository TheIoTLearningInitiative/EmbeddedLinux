# Virtual File System

> A virtual file system (VFS) or virtual filesystem switch is an abstraction layer on top of a more concrete file system. The purpose of a VFS is to allow client applications to access different types of concrete file systems in a uniform way.  [Wikipedia]()

> The Linux kernel implements the concept of Virtual File System (VFS, originally Virtual Filesystem Switch), so that it is (to a large degree) possible to separate actual "low-level" filesystem code from the rest of the kernel.
