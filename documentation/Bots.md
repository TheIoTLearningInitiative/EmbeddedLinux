## Bot Revolution

> Bots are simply Telegram accounts operated by software – not people – and they'll often have AI features. They can do anything – teach, play, search, broadcast, remind, connect, integrate with other services, or even pass commands to the Internet of Things [Bot Revolution](https://telegram.org/blog/bot-revolution)

## Bots: An introduction for developers

Bots are third-party applications that run inside Telegram. Users can interact with bots by sending them messages, commands and inline requests. You control your bots using HTTPS requests to our bot API. [Bots: An introduction for developers](https://core.telegram.org/bots)

Alright, a new bot. How are we going to call it? Please choose a name for your bot.
