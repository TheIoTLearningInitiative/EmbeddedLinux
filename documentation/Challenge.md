__Instruction__ 

> Under your Linux Host Development, install the required dependencies, download and decompress the Intel Edison Linux Sources and compile your own Intel Edison Board Support Package

# 01 Build Systems, Yocto Board Support Package, Compilation, Make, Kernel Version

Section [Build Systems Yocto Board Support Package Compilation](https://theiotlearninginitiative.gitbooks.io/embedded-linux/content/documentation/Compilation.html)

__Instruction__ 

> Choose another version

- [01 Org Intel Edison Linux Kernel](https://github.com/01org/edison-linux)
  - edison-3.19.5
  - edison-3.10.98
  - edison-3.10.17

# 02 Build Systems, Yocto Board Support Package, Modules, Simulated Sensor Kernel Module

Section [Build Systems Yocto Board Support Package Modules](https://theiotlearninginitiative.gitbooks.io/embedded-linux/content/documentation/Modules.html)

__Instruction__ 

> Write a Linux Kernel module under that gets registered under /sys/kernel/sensor using Native Compilation, Simulated Sensor Kernel Module will generate a random number

Look at Linux Kernel Sysfs Documentation 

```sh
root@edison:~# ls /sys/kernel/sensor
status
root@edison:~# cat /sys/kernel/sensor/status
456
root@edison:~# 
```

# 03 Build Systems, Yocto Board Support Package, Modules, Simulated Sensor Kernel Module, Load Automatically At Boot Time 

Section [Build Systems Yocto Board Support Package Modules](https://theiotlearninginitiative.gitbooks.io/embedded-linux/content/documentation/Modules.html)

__Instruction__

> Make your Simulated Sensor Module load automatically at boot time by incorporating your Linux Kernel module into your Yocto Board Support Package Compilation 

# 04 Build Systems, Yocto Board Support Package, Modules, Simulated Sensor Kernel Module, InternetOfThings101/main.py 

Section [Build Systems Yocto Board Support Package Modules](https://theiotlearninginitiative.gitbooks.io/embedded-linux/content/documentation/Modules.html)

__Instruction__

> Under EmbeddedLinux/main.py replace existing functionality/logic under functionDataSensor to use now the random number generated by the Simulated Sensor Kernel Module

# 05 Initialization, Dual Boot

Section [Initialization Dual Boot](https://theiotlearninginitiative.gitbooks.io/embedded-linux/content/documentation/DualBoot.html)

__Instruction__

> Allow Intel Edison to boot Ubilinux from uSD, Yocto shall be maintained under main flash partition

# 06 User Space, Virtual Network Computing

Section [User Space Virtual Network Computing](https://theiotlearninginitiative.gitbooks.io/embedded-linux/content/documentation/VirtualNetworkComputing.html)

__Instruction__

> Enable Virtual Network Computing server from Ubilinux under uSD, access Intel Edison from your Development Host using Virtual Network Computing client

# 07 User Space, Services

Section [User Space Services](https://theiotlearninginitiative.gitbooks.io/embedded-linux/content/documentation/Services.html)

__Instruction__

> Configure SystemD to run your script EmbeddedLinux/main.py on startup

# 08 Libraries, Temboo

Section [Libraries Temboo](https://theiotlearninginitiative.gitbooks.io/embedded-linux/content/documentation/Temboo.html)

__Instruction__

> Implement 1 CHOREOS under EmbeddedLinux/main.py

# 09 Subsystems, LED

Section [Subsystems LED](https://theiotlearninginitiative.gitbooks.io/embedded-linux/content/documentation/Led.html)

__Instruction__

>  Enable under your Yocto Board Support Package Compilation the macros LEDS_TRIGGERS and LEDS_TRIGGER_HEARTBEAT so you can control a Led from the Grove Indoor Environment Kit attached to one of the GPIOs

# 10 Application Development, Bots, Telegram Bot

Section [Application Development Bots](https://theiotlearninginitiative.gitbooks.io/embedded-linux/content/documentation/Bots.html)

__Instruction__

>  Create a new Bot and implement under your script EmbeddedLinux/main.py 2 commands, to report data from functionDataSensor and to execute the action under functionDataActuator from any Telegram client

# 11 Application Development, Artificial Intelligence, Wit.Ai

Section [Application Development Artificial Intelligence Wit.Ai](https://theiotlearninginitiative.gitbooks.io/embedded-linux/content/documentation/ArtificialIntelligence.html)

__Instruction__

>  Implement under your script EmbeddedLinux/main.py 2 commands, to report data from functionDataSensor and to execute the action under functionDataActuator from from the Wit.Ai bot

# 12 Software Version Control System Pushing Code 

Section [Software Version Control System](https://theiotlearninginitiative.gitbooks.io/internetofthings101/content/documentation/ControlVersionSystem.html
