# Introduction

> Operating systems based on the Linux kernel are used in embedded systems such as consumer electronics (i.e. set-top boxes, smart TVs, in-vehicle infotainment (IVI), networking equipment (such as wireless routers), machine control, industrial automation, navigation equipment, spacecraft flight software, and medical instruments in general). [Wikipedia Linux on Embedded Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_on_embedded_systems)

> The Embedded Debian Project is making Debian GNU/Linux a mainstream choice for embedded projects. [Emdebian Homepage](http://www.emdebian.org/)

> Thanks to their versatility, operating systems based on the Linux kernel can be also found in mobile devices that are actually touchscreen-based embedded devices, such as smartphones and tablets, together with personal digital assistants (PDAs) and portable media players that also include a touchscreen.

> Linux now spans the spectrum of computing applications, including IBM's tiny Linux wrist watch, hand-held devices (PDAs and cell phones), Internet appliances, thin clients, firewalls, industrial robotics, telephony infrastructure equipment, and even cluster-based supercomputers.
