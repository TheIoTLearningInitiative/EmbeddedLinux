# Introduction

> Operating systems based on the Linux kernel are used in embedded systems such as consumer electronics (i.e. set-top boxes, smart TVs, in-vehicle infotainment (IVI), networking equipment (such as wireless routers), machine control, industrial automation, navigation equipment, spacecraft flight software, and medical instruments in general).

## Linux Kernel Size

> One big problem area when using Linux in an embedded project is the size of the Linux kernel. This document describes how to configure the Linux kernel to use a small amount of memory and flash [Kernel Size Tuning Guide](http://elinux.org/Kernel_Size_Tuning_Guide)
