# eSpeak

> eSpeak is a compact open source software speech synthesizer for English and other languages, for Linux and Windows [Homepage](http://espeak.sourceforge.net)

# VoiceRss

> The Voice RSS Text-to-Speech (TTS) API allows conversion of textual content to speech easier than ever. Just connect to our Text-to-Speech (TTS) API with a few lines of code and get verbal representation of a textual content. For converting text to speech you donâ€™t need special hardware to care about intensive use of CPU and memory during conversion operations. [Homepage](http://www.voicerss.org/)

# OpenSST

> An Open Source Speech To Text Project

> The OpenSTT project is aimed at creating an open source speech-to-text model that can be used by individuals and company to allow for high accuracy, low-latency conversion of speech into text. OpenSST
