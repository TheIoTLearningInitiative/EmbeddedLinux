# Yocto Board Support Package

## Board Support Package

> In embedded systems, a board support package (BSP) is an implementation of specific support code (software) for a given (device motherboard) board that conforms to a given operating system. It is commonly built with a bootloader that contains the minimal device support to load the operating system and device drivers for all the devices on the board.
