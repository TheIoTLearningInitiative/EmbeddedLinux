## Kernel Interfaces

### SFI Simple Firmware Interface

> How does SFI relate to ACPI? While some modern platforms can used SFI instead of using ACPI, SFI is not intended to replace ACPI on general purpose systems. If a platform were to export both SFI and ACPI booted an OS that also supports both, the OS should use the platform's ACPI support and ignore SFI.

```sh
    User Linux Next
    git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git
    v4.1-rc6 tag, mrproper'd and rebuilt, 
```
